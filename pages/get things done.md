A list of things I've collated over time that help me get things done. 

* [[maintain energy, sharpness, and mental clarity]]
* Take the time to [[make good decisions]]
* Run through the [[Functions checklist]]
* Keep a source of truth document with key information up to date (e.g. if we were randomly asked by the CEO about one of your initiatives, what document would you send to get them up to speed?)
* Provide context to the relevant people and clearly structure the problem
	* Expected timelines / urgency
	* Impact
	* What help is required
* Break the problem / solution / next steps down into manageable parts and execute on it
* Regular meetings can help when there are multiple moving parts / stakeholders ([[run effective meetings]])
* Work backwards from the expected outcome
* Outline key owners for each action item
* Outline expected completion dates for each action item
